# wim (WIP)

---

A simple, easy to use, terminal text editor. Hopefully this can eventually fill in the gab between nano and vim.

Current features:
* Displaying text

Eventual features:
* Editing text, writing to file
* Two 'windows', one for editing and one for commands
* Regex searching, should be easy
* Syntax coloring, or at least some coloring
